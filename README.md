### Installing MySQL
Download and Install MySQL Workbench from https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/
#### Using our database
1. Either using workbench directly. (if prefer using command line, go to 2)
  - Create a new connection using:
  - Hostname: mathlab.utsc.utoronto.ca
  - Port: 3306
  - Username: linjun9
  - Password: linjun9
  - Using the cscc43s18_linjun9 database
2. Run the following commands:  
  - mysql -u linjun9 -h mathlab.utsc.utoronto.ca -plinjun9
  - use cscc43s18_linjun9;
#### Using your own database
1. Create a new local database using:
  - Hostname: 127.0.0.1
  - Port: 3306
  - Username: root
  - Password: 
2. Open the *create.sql* script in the `\Project\create.sql` directory in MySQL Workbench
3. Modify the first 2 lines to run *create schema cscc01* and *use cscc01
4. Run the script
5. This is initialize the local database to be ready for the application.
6. Open the java source file *ConnectDatabase.java* under `/Project/src/app/java/com/model/database/api/` and change CONNECTION_URL, USERNAME, and PASSWORD accordingly.

### Running Unit Tests

The JUnit 5 and hamcrest libraries must be in the build path of the project:
1. Go to **Project** > **Properties** > **Java Build Path** > **Add Library**
2. Select **JUnit** > **JUnit 5** > **Finish**
3. The location of the Eclipse project must be the **Project** directory, and the source folder must be **Project\src**.
4. This must be performed for the unit tests to run as their relative directory to the root of the project matters.
